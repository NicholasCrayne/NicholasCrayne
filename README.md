Name: Nicholas Crayne
DOB: April 26th, 1995

This place houses much of my recent higher education programming files.
All of these files are from my time at Farmingdale State College.
Repository names designate the course code for the respective assignments.

DISCLAIMER:
Many of these files are not executable. This is for several reasons.
1. I do not wish for my fellow students to be able to download and use these files for their own assignment submissions.
2. Some of these courses are those that I may be currently enrolled in.
3. These files are simply for me to demonstrate my knowledge of the several languages that I have learned.
